Degrees of freedom

MacOS 8.6 and MacOS 9.0
IREZ ZV Drivers version 2F5 and 2F6
Kritter PCMCIA and Kritter/SV
Quicktime 4.1.2 and Quicktime 4.0.3

General problem is that the Kritter products seem to have become quite
unreliable  on MacOS9

Working with two computers (333Mhz non-firewire and 500Mhz firewire) 
Initially both computers were running MacOS9 with the latest Quicktime
and both computers exhibited lots of problems with both the old and new
Kritter drivers.  The bugs on the 333Mhz running OS9 were the same as
the bugs on the 500Mhz machine with OS9 as documented below.

The problem that really got me cheezed was the fact that when you
capture at 160x120, the material is actually captured at 640x240 (yes
that is right), but the "Current Size" in quicktime "Size" is 160x120. 
Quicktime player shows the strange video normally but ClipBoard cannot
find  anything except the actual size of 640x240.  In info for
Quicktime, the Format is 640x240, the Normal Size is 640x240 and the
Current Size is 160x120.  Quicktime player shows it in 160x120.  FIle
sizes indicate that there is really 640x240 of data in the file.  All of
the Quicktime Calls I can make inside Clipboard report the 640x240 size

see http://www-personal.umich.edu/~csev/projects/cb2k/bugs/videosize.txt
for example code.

We start by reformatting the 333Mhz system as 8.6 - Interestingly, this
works swell if we tell it to blast the system folder completely.

Install the IREZ Old drivers from the Orange/Silver CD (W98/Macintosh)

Kriter/SV works with the QT3 drivers from the 8.6 CD and ReelEyes
captures 160x120 natively as 160x120.

Upgrade to the latest QT from the net (4.1.2 I think) - Again ReelEyes
captures 160x120 as native 160x120.

Testing the Kritter/PCMCIA - in captured media size is fine but the last
second of the audio is a horrible screeching noise.  Try the Kritter/SV
- horrible screeching noise.  Try to capture with Clipboard - same
screeching noise.

[Note added 5/15/00 - The screeching is a Quicktime Problem and 
is accepted by Apple and will hopefully be fixed soon.]

Check for on-line updates - none.

When the file is flattenned by ReelEyes, the screeching is still
present.

Install Kritter/USB drivers from the CD.

Use Kritter/USB with ReelEyes - Everything works fine except for the
screeching noise is there as well.

Uninstall Quicktime and reinstall it from the net.

Capturing still has screeching noise.

Uninstall QT 4.1.2 - reinstall QT 4.0.3.

Reeleyes capture with Kritter/SV works swell and there is no screeching
sound.

Note (500Mhz mac has never exhibited the screeching sound in any tests)

On 500Mhz Mac running OS9, uninstall QT 4.1.2 - reinstall QT 4.0.3 full
install Capture with ReelEyes/Kritter/SV - size is wrong, audio and
video are fine (no screeching)

On the 333/8.6 mac, using the new drivers (F6) and QT 4.0.3 when the
Kritter/PCMCIA is inserted and a capture is done, things are fine -
Video is OK, Audio has no screeching, and the size is correct.  However
if you re-run RealEyes again you see black.  If you eject the ZV Drivers
and reinsert the card, it works again with the first ReelEyes Capture
but not the second.  (This was previously reported to IREZ).

Kritter/SV does not exhibit this behavior - it does multiple captures
without the need to be reinserted with the F6 drivers.

Testing the 500Mhz system, OS9, New drivers, QT4.0.3 Krittter/PCMCIA
cannot record at all - light comes on but we see black screens in
ReelEyes.

We switch both systems to the Old ZV drivers (F5 - One file - no ZV
Enabler) and reboot both systems.

On the 500 MHz OS9 QT 4.0.3 old ZV drivers, the Kritter/PCMCIA still
shows black.  The Kritter/SV performs flawlessly.

On the 333Mhz OS 8 QT 4.0.3 old ZV drivers, Kritter/PCMCIA performs
flawlessly - no screeching audio, video OK, works for multiple captures
without the need for restart.  Capture works flawlessly with both
ReelEyes and Clipboard (There is never a situation where ClipBoard and
ReelEyes have different results).

Similarly the Kritter/SV works flawlessly. on the 333Mhz system.

Now for more structured testing....

For each configuration, the following tests were run.  Capture video
with ReelEyes.  Playback the video, listening to audio.  Open in QT
Player, check Format to see if the size was correct (not 640x240). 
Close ReelEyes, reopen ReelEyes and see if a capture would work.

Four problems were encountered in various combinations.

Black Screen immediately when ReelEyes is started - press record - 
  video appears - press mouse to end record and "A -2048" error 
  occurred in NMFFI" and no file is saved
Capture has 1 second or screeching in the audio at the end of the capture.
Capture has mismatch between the Current size and the Format.
Capture does not work a second time without ejecting the PCMCIA Card

The entire suite of tests was run twice.  The test order was varied
between the first and second pass.  Other than black screen, when one
test is failed, you can assume that the other tests were performed and
passed.  So, for example, MacOS86/QT4.1.2/OLD ZV Drivers failed the
audio test but PASSED the black screen, size , and second capture tests.

This DOES not seem to depend on the capture software used.  For these
tests, I used ReelEyes in all configurations, but for many of them I
have used ClipBoard and Hack TV and so far I have never seen different
results because of the capture software used.  I assume that is because
they are all based on HackTV ultimately and are making the right
Quicktime calls.

[Note added 05/15/00 - In disucssion with the author of ReelEyes, I 
found out that ReelEyes is NOT based on HackTV.  This interesting 
because  HackTV and CliBoard use the Sequence Grabber but apparently
ReelEyes does not.  But all three exhibited the same problems.  Might
lead one ot think it is NOT the Sequence Grabber (part of Quicktime)]

Configurations for the Kritter/PCMCIA:
MacOS9/QT 4.1.2/Old ZV Drivers - Black Screen
MacOS9/QT 4.1.2/New ZV Drivers - Black Screen
MacOS9/QT 4.0.3/Old ZV Drivers - Black Screen
MacOS9/QT 4.0.3/New ZV Drivers - Black Screen

MacOS8.6/QT 4.1.2/Old ZV Drivers - Screeching
MacOS8.6/QT 4.1.2/New ZV Drivers - Screeching Second capture fails
MacOS8.6/QT 4.0.3/Old ZV Drivers - Perfect
MacOS8.6/QT 4.0.3/New ZV Drivers - Second capture fails

Configurations for the Kritter/SV:
MacOS9/QT 4.1.2/Old ZV Drivers - Size is wrong
MacOS9/QT 4.1.2/New ZV Drivers - Size is wrong
MacOS9/QT 4.0.3/Old ZV Drivers - Size is wrong
MacOS9/QT 4.0.3/New ZV Drivers - Size is wrong

MacOS8.6/QT 4.1.2/Old ZV Drivers - Audio Screeching
MacOS8.6/QT 4.1.2/New ZV Drivers - Audio Screeching
MacOS8.6/QT 4.0.3/Old ZV Drivers  - Perfect
MacOS8.6/QT 4.0.3/New ZV Drivers - Perfect

Overall Conclusion

QT 4.1.2 has a problem with audio screeching on MacOS 8.6 - horrible bug IMHO
[Note added 05/15/00 - I was right no this one :) ]

IREZ Drivers are flaky.  They get flakier as the OS and IREZ version goes up.
IREZ drivers are profoundly broken (black screen and size problem) in MacOS9
