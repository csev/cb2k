<h2>ClipBoard-2000 </h2>
<h3>Online Lecture Production Tool</h3>
<p>
<b>Note: </b>Before viewing any lectures, make sure to install 
the <a href=http://www.apple.com/quicktime/>Quicktime
</a> player.  If you have upgraded your browser since Quicktime was 
last installed, you may have to reinstall Quicktime.
<p>
ClipBoard-2000 is a tool which allows faculty to easily record web-based
lectures using nothing more than a notebook computer with attached camera.
ClipBoard-2000 takes PowerPoint as its input and syncronizes audio, video,
PowerPoint, and annotations to produce the on-line lecture.
ClipBoard creates a single Quicktime file with up to 6 tracks of 
information.  
<p>
<b>New:</b>
I just added a new feature - document camera support.  You need two 
video capture devices to make this work.  But it is a pretty cool thing.
Take a look at a
<a href=lectures/doccam.htm>short sample lecture using the document camera</a>.

This is a small Alpha-test of my product which is still under
furious development.  If it blows up - oh well.  
Carefully reproduce it and send me a note at csev@umich.edu - 
I will fix it as soon as I can.  To download the software and participate, go 
to my <a href=alpha/index.htm>Alpha Test Page</a>.
<p>
I have an initial alpha test of a partially working PC
version.  See
my <a href=alpha/index.htm>Alpha Test Page</a> for details.
<p>
You will need a pretty modern/fast computer.  I use a PowerBook G3-333 
with MacOS86.  You should use Quicktime 4.0.
