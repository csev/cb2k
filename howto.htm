<h2>HowTo Run The ClipBoard-2000</h2>
<pre>
Before you start make sure that the video stuff is all installed 
properly.  I use a QuickCam Pro through USB and it is OK.

Save your PowerPoint to HTML - This can use any size and can be 
either JPG or GIF.  I have used Office-98 on the Mac, Office-97
on the PC, and Office-2000 on the PC successfully.  All 
that matters is the files look like img001.gif, img001.GIF, img001.JPG,
or img001.jpg.    If you have PowerPoint on the PC, then you need 
to transfer the files one way or another.  I have even used VirtualPC 
on the Mac running Office-97 successfully.  The ONLY files that matter
(so far) are the img*.* files.

Run ClipBoard
  Close the infernal splash screen
  If you don't have video, use Lecture | Audio Only to remove the video
  Use Lecture | Select Directory and navigate to the directory which 
    contains the PowerPoint output - there is a 4 slide presentation
    in the ClipBoard-2000 directory
  Use Lecture | Record Lecture to bring up the video and audio boxes
  You are not yet recording
  In the video box, you can select which camera, adjust settings for the camera
    and adjust the compression.
  Mostly you can use the defaults - but under Compression, you might play
    with the settings.  I default the settings to a reasonable JPEG 
    compression at 8 frames a second.  It is a good compromise compression
    ending up with about 35KB/sec.   You will have to recompress this 
    before web delivery using Lecture | Recompress.
  For Audio settings - Make sure you select the proper microphone/source
    and then adjust the level until the meter indicates that the audio 
    is good enough.
  Once you hit OK in audio, you will see youself being previewed.  Press
    the record to start recording the lecture. 

Recording a lecture.
  To advance a slide use the + button or click on the little 
    thumbnail view of the next slide.
  If you have to sneeze, press the "Pause" button - then when you want
    to continue press "Continue"
  You have three tools (pencil, pointer, and text).  As you select each
    the cursor changes - you can also select the color for the text and
    scribble.   These work just about how you would expect.
  You can also make a clean sheet of paper by pressing the Clear 
     button.
  When you are done - press quit.

After the lecture is recorded (filename media) you may want to recompress
the lecture material using the Sorensen Codec at a low bit rate.  This copies
the data into a file called media.mov (all in the PowerPoint output
directory).  When the software brings up the dialog box make sure that you are
in the right directory and that the file is named media.mov - expect that
this might take several minutes - progress bars come up during some of the
steps.

It is important to note that recompression is OPTIONAL.  It is only necessary
if you will be putting the lecture up on the web.  For quickie demos off
the hard disk skip the recompression step.

To create the lecture use the Lecture | Make Lecture command.  This also may 
take several minutes to complete putting up a few progress bars. 

To test the lecture use File | Open to find the file lecture.mov in the
PowerPoint output directory.  Just press play.

You might also try opening the file in the QuickTime 4 player - take a look 
at Movie | Get Info to see how the tracks work.  You might also play with
Edit | Enable tracks to see how everything can be turned on and off.
