<h1>What Audio Compression to Use?</h1>
<p>
If you are interested, I have also provided a similar
<a href=indexvid.htm>Video Compression</a> (7MB) page.  
You will need some patience if you have a modem, 
it is over 7MB in size and takes over a minute to load
on my 10Mb/sec connection at work.  Once it loads, you can play with each 
of the movies to make A/B comparisons.
<p>
This page attempts to help determine what audio compression should 
be used for both the archival media and for the web streaming media.
To produce this material a short piece was digitized using no compression and then recompressed (off-line) into each of the formats.
<p>
For the archival quality, the key is to use the lowest disk space which keeps quality very high.  For web delivery, you can sacrifice
quality somewhat to save on the bandwidth.
<p>
In my (ad hoc) testing, while video is nice to have and helps form and maintain a bond, audio quality is very important.  Bad audio can
cause a student to become fatigued.  So, a good rule of thumb is to allocate at least 50-60% of the anticiapted bandwidth to audio.
<p>
From this testing, use either <b>Uncompressed</b> or <b>IMA 4:1</b> as your archival format.  For web streaming at 56Kb or lower, 
the <b>PureVoice 19:1</b> seems like the logical choice.  For web streaming above 128Kb, <b>PureVoice 9:1</b> gives good quality at a pretty low bit rate.  Remember that to convert from Kb/sec (modem speeds) to KB/sec (storage amounts) you must divide by 8.  Since each byte (B) contains 8 bits (b).
<p>
If in your testing, you have any comments on this page, please send them to me at csev@umich.edu.

The best way to use this table is to let all of the clips download into cache and then go up and down pressing the
play/pause buttons.
