I can't get my machine to record any audio input.  I've fooled around with
the controls both on the Mac itself and with ClipBoard options, but when I
play back my recorded demo lectures, they don't have sound.  I've asked our
local Mac guru what's going on, but he was unable to help me.  Could
someone let me know how to rig this up properly?  I am trying to record
test lectures to make sure that audio-only lectures can be captured with a
lapel microphone.
</b>
<p>
I have not gotten a lapel microphone to work with a Mac.  
There are three several types of microphones in the world.
<ul>
<li>  Standard Condenser microphones (As one might buy from Radio Shack)
<li>  Powered PC Microphones (As one might buy from Best Buy) 
<li>  Powered Mac Microphones (Yes, there IS a difference)
<li>  XLR based mics used by professional sound people (really big connector
wirth three pins)
</ul>
I have tried a PC microphone with my PowerBook and it did NOT work.
<p>
There is a widget which converts from the standard microphone to the
Apple PlainTalk input available at:

What microphone do you recommend for audio lecture capture in a
classroom situation in which the professor is going to be walking around,
   gesturing, etc.?  The built-in microphone would not be suitable for this
   kind of capture I don't think.  Is there any other kind of unobtrusive
   microphone that will work with ClipBoard?
</b>
<p>
If I were doing lectures live and taping them, I would use a camcorder and 
tape the lecture too.  Then 
use the Audio-out and video out from the camera to digitize - 
that way you should get really nice levels.   
Then any-old RadioShack or Best Buy condensing mic will work (as they are 
designed for camcorders).  If you are really cool, then use a 
wireless microphone - but they are expensive - 
a really good one is easily $600.00.

What is a good wireless Microphone?
</b>
<p>
CERN uses an Azden in conjunction with a CamCorder for their WebLecture Archive
project.  It is professional quality and works well - but it is designed 
to plug into a CamCorder, not a computer.
<pre>
FROM PROFEEL
WR22Pro Discrete 2-channel VHF Receiver
WL/T-Pro Bodypack transmitter and wireless mic
WHX-Pro VHF handheld microphone system
</pre>
Again, if you are serious about quality, use a camcorder, tripod, wireless 
mic, headphones, and tape the lecture in addition to digitizing it.

   Is there a specific reason that Krittercam is the camera of choice for
   ClipBoard?  People have said that
   there were better cameras out there to choose from.  Krittercam is endorsed
   by Apple, but so are others.  In my notes from the last affiliates meeting
   I noticed that Louis (or you?) said that any kind of video camera that
   works with a Mac can be used with ClipBoard.  Is there another camera that
   might work better in a live lecture situation?
</b>
<p>
The Kritter is a PCMCIA camera.  Because it can directly access memory, it does not need to send compressed images (like a USB solution).  Because we 
will be doing (usually two) steps of compression, having a third is 
bad for quality.  So the best quality is achieved using an uncompressed source, 
Photo-JPEG during record and Sorensen for deployment.   Also the Kritter takes less resources than most USB solutions.
<p>
But the USB solutions can and do work - they are nice and compact 
but the quality suffers.
<p>
If you want to use some separate camera (say like a camcorder)
with some type of video out, use 
the IREZ CapSure card (~$99) - it is a PCMCIA card with all of the advantages
of the Kritter/USB.

Can you please tell me more about the document camera feature of
   ClipBoard?  I don't quite understand what that's all about yet (at least
   not well enough to explain it to others).
</b>
<p>
It is basically putting a digital camera into ClipBoard.  You can take a snapshot (pressing the G button) of some object or writing into the "PowerPoint" area of 
the screen.  You can either do audio-only with a document camera or audio/video with a document camera.  It is probably easiest to take a look at the 
sample up on the web site.

We have a G3 with S-Video In already - can we use the Dazzle for the Instructor camera and the Existing S-Video in for the Document Camera?
</b>
<p>
If this is a desktop G3 with S-Video in, then  
you probably have an ATI card or something.
<p>
I have not tested this configuration and given how flakey Quicktime is with two video sources, I give it a 50-50 chance of success - but 
if it fails, it should blow up right away - Your images will be wrong or
your video will be wrong - but it will be obvious.
<p>
The key is to first test the instructor camera without the 
document camera, then test the document camera without the 
instructor camera (select document camera, and audio only).  
Then try both cameras simultaneously after the first two tests are fine.
If the two camera test fails, then I may have you send me some debug 
output (debug.txt) to see if I can figure something out.  
Perhaps I can fix it with some fooling around and a new version.
Because I don't have acces to this type of card, I cannot easily test it.
If you know where I can get a card for the G3 desktop, let me know.
<p>
So, keep in touch and let me know how it goes.
