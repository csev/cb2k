<h1>About the ClipBoard-2000</h1>
This product was initially developed by 
<a href=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~csev/ target=_new>
Dr. Charles Severance
</a> during the Summer and Fall of 1999 at the University of Michigan
<a href=http://www.ummu.umich.edu/ target=_new>
Media Union</a>.
<p>
The Media Union has advanced learning technology as part of its core mission
to the University of Michigan. ClipBoard is one of the Media Union's
Advanced Technology Group's exploratory projects in this area.  
<p>
Hopefully, by the Spring of 2000, the product will be used in a number
of courses on-campus.  Early adopters include the College of Engineering and
the School of Public Health.  During this pilot test, users outside of the
University of Michigan will be allowed to download and use ClipBoard as long
as they understand that it is only a Alpha (or Beta) test of the product.
The goal of Spring 2000 is to understand the real requirements for such a tool
so that a more broadly useful tool can be deployed during the Summer of 2000.
<p>
Long term goals include the ability to easily move lecture-style content into
object oriented lecture repositories such as the IBM Digital Library and the 
Apple Learnting Interchange.

<h2>Using ClipBoard-2000</h2>
ClipBoard is intended to be used in a wide variety of environments ranging from K-12 through higher-ed and corporate environments.  As such it is designed
to be intuitive and easy to use.  ClipBoard preoduces web-based lectures
using Quicktime technology from Apple Computer, Inc.
<p>
ClipBoard supports (at least) two basic modes of usage:
<ul>
<li><b>Lecture Replacement</b> - A lecture (often with video) is recorded
using ClipBoard with no audience present and viewed by students 
instead of attending the lecture.  This is the "distance education" 
scenario.  This is also useful when one wants to create a lecture archive in 
a particular topic such as the CERN Web Lecture Archive.
<li><b>Lecture Recording</b> - In this mode, ClipBoard is used to record 
(typically only the audio) a lecture while it is being given live.  This
lecture is then uploaded for the students to review and replay as part
of an entire learning process.  
</ul>
