<p>
Alpha 8 contains bug fixes and a new feature.
<ul>
<li>Allow the advance of a new slide while not recording 1/6 (still to come making the clear button work before recording)
<li>Make files of the form Slide1.JPG and Slide1.GIF something that is looked for - these come from PC Save As 1/6
<li>Finally make the timer infinite 1/6
<li>Allow slides up to 1050 in either dimension - Who wants to do Portrait?? - 1/6
<li>Fix the misleading messsage when no slides were found. 1/6
<li> Default the sample rate to 44.1 Khz - 1/6
</ul>
Still to do: Exit capture gracefully and allow starting on a blank screen
