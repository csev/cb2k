Alpha 13 
Fixes bugs reported by end users.
<ul>
<li>
Added a simple document camera (second video input) to the system - first you enable the document camera and then you press the "G" key.
<li>
Upgraded the include files and lib files on my development system to QT 4.0 
(needed for the document camera)
<li>
Fixes the bug where you can's use the +/- key before recording starts
<li>
Added a little display regarding the number of slides remaining at the request 
UM Engineering CPD.  :)
<li>
Fixed an error during make lecture where the borders would turn blue 
because I had a non-fatal error occur while the running status box was up.
I both fixed a bug and made things work better if there are other instances
where alert boxes pop up during Make Lecture.
<li>
Added a little more to the debug.txt file - when a fatal error happens.
</ul>
TTFN
