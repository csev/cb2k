Alpha 10 
was written primarily on an airplane on my trip from Michigan to CERN
in Switzerland.  Most of these features were coded over the Atlantic.  
Upon arrival I gave a talk at CERN in which the "blank page" feature
was broken, much to the delight of the CENR audience.  So here I am 
sitting in Buiding 40 - (having fixed the bug) and putting up Alpha 10.
<ul>
<li>Changed the minimum memory size for the application - hopefully this
will eliminate the (-108) memory errors.
<li>Added a new, undocumented feature.  This allows you to publish the 
lecture at a different size than the lecture was recorded at.  For example,
you might want slides to be 800x600 during lecture capture so they fill
the whole screen for the viewing audience.  But when you deliver the lecture 
over the web you might want to make them smaller, say 400x300 to save bandwidth
or manage smaller screen space better.  To do this, you add a file to 
the lecture directory called pubsize.gif - the contents of this file are
unimportant but the size of this file is used to determine the size 
of the ultimate lecture produced.  It is a temporary hack because I need to 
come up with a more elegant way to communicate this information.  There are 
a whole series of "lecture-production" options that I need to add ultimately.
<li>Fixed a tiny bug introduced in Alpha 9 where it would say 
"switch(npart) value 1" when you hit a menu item while recording :).
<li>Changed the error handler to tell you that -108 is running out of memory.
<li>Went through the capture loop and made everything non-fatal.  If something
goes wrong, at least it will end the loop, dump out data as much as possible and then terminate - rather than just quitting mid-loop.
<li>
</ul>
