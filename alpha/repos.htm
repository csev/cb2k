<h1>Repository Issues</h1>
ClipBoard has two basic phases (1) lecture record and (2) lecture publication.
Ultimately we are moving to a repository model where another flow is 
possible in a three step process.  The three-step process is (1) lecture 
record, (2) upload to reposiitory, and (3) publish from repository.
<p>
This will allow a single lecture to be published in a multitude of formats:
<ul>
<li>Quicktime, Quicktime/HTML, Real/HTML, Real/SMIL, or Microsoft
<li>Many levels of Bandwidth from 14kbps to LAN speeds
<li>The ability to select or deselect any of the channels (audio, video, 
slides, text, pointer, scribble) depending on the user's wants.
</ul>
To allow the hundreds of different possibilities, the 
publishing process must be done in a server after the 
user has made their selections.
<p>
A repository will not be required.  Using CB2K, a user can produce several 
static variations which can then be placed on a CD or a straight web server.
