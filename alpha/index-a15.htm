<ul>
<li>
Fixed the pointer tracking to be more adaptive so it tracks quick motion 
but then backs off when the motion is continuous.
<li>
Changed the defaults for audio and video comporession back to PJPEG.  TZo
override the defaults, use Setup Video and Setup Audio.
<li>
Did a thorough analysis looking for memory leaks in the Record Lecture 
and Make Lecture - added a bunch of stuff to debug.txt - fixed one more leak
in Record Lecture which might cause one to run out of memory after a few 
recordings without exiting ClipBoard.
</ul>
