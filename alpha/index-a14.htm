<ul>
<li>
Tweaked the document cam some more
<li>
Changed the little display of the numbers to red when < 10 minutes of 
disk space remain.
<li>
Added the automatic pointer tracking feature.  Every three seconds if 
the pointer is in the slide area, is set to point, and has moved at least 
30 pixels from the last position, ClipBoard automatically creates a 
pointer event.
<li>
Fixed a bug where the display got messed up for slides less than 400x300.
</ul>
