Well, this is a nice release - a few things finally work.  Dual 
camera (Instructor/Document) 
support has moved to a level that I would call "worth a try to 
play with".  It works with several configurations:
<ul>
<li>
Instrcutor camera = Dazzle / Document Camera = CapSure.  I REALLY 
like this combination because it allows high quality 640x480 captures
and both inputs are S-Video/Composite inputs so you can hook it up to 
a real document camera and other video sources, say like in a studio.
<li>
Instructor camera = CapSure / Document Camera = Kritter/USB.  I assume
that the Kriter/SV will be identical to the CapSure.  This config is strange
because the high-quality capture is the (tiny) instructor while the lower 
quality Kritter is the document camera.  OK for demos with the Kritter/SV.
<li>
Instructor camera = Kritter-USB DocumentCamera = CapSure.
Unfortunately I am still nervous about the capability of the Kritter/USB
to reliably record media.  This would be a Really nice 
home office configuration if not
for the continuous fear that you won't get your media :(.
<li>
The other new feature is the ability to "not record" any media.  This
feature is (currently) called Sync-Only.  This allows you to do everything 
about the lecture except digitize the audio and video.  This would be
useful if you were digitizing the media on another computer or had
pre-digitized media that you were playing while synchronizing the slides.
<p>
Detailed Changes
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Added the "Sync-Only" (aka gDontRecord) feature - turned out to be really 
easy.  I did it while sitting in a recliner watching a basketball game between
the MSU Spartans and Penn State.  MSU had a 15+ point lead so I could focus
on code writing.  Wireless networking is pretty cool.  I even talked to my 
family from time to time.
<li>
I altered how the defaults for video (frame rate/jpeg compression) are set.  
Without knowing it, I was messing up the Dazzle driver by doing 
things in a certain order - I think that it 
is Dazzle's problem - but what the heck - I can work arond things with the
best of them.  What I did was a little more complicated but seems to work with
all the cameras I have tested.
<li>
I have spent a lot of time on two features that the production version 
currently does not use - frame grabbing directly to the video 
drivers, rather than through the layer Quicktime calls the "Sequence Grabber".
I got a lot of help from Dave, Michael, and Kevin on the QuickTime-API 
developers list, but that code still does not work.  The document
camera images come through a sequence grabber instead from the VDIG.
Someday, I will get the VDIG stuff working and then I expect that 
every possible combination of cameras can be used.
</ul>
Actually - Alpha 16 was very close to working.  All that really was broken
was the default thing on the Dazzle.  
<p>
my next steps are to actually have a few users try out the document camera
on some real lectures and get some reliability feedback.
