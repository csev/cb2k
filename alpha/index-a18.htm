<p>
It has been a while since the last release. This release works on a 
synchronization problem where the clicks and the audio tend to drift apart.
<p>
Also, a few hacks that I added and have been playing with are in this release.
If you experience problems compare A17 and A18.  Some bugs may have crept 
into the code.
<p>
<b>Bad Bug Alert:</b>Somehow, At the moment of the start of the recording of a
lecture Quicktime nearly grabs all of the available 
disk (take a look at the free disk
on your main hard disk) - this causes some data to be unsavable to disk.  
This happens most often when a long sequence of screen grabs is done, but can also happen after a lot of scribbling.  I am working on a fix but until then, 
it would be best to exit and restart ClipBoard each time you record a lecture.
<ul>
<li>
Changed the internal time tracking from a relative scheme to an 
absolute scheme.  This should fix some of the problems with time slipping
as something is used a lot such as pointers, etc.
<li>
Added a simple AppleScripting capability.  This was part of my secret plan
to make CLipBoard publishing available as an off-line process.  Here is a simple example:
<pre>

set dirname to choose folder with prompt "Hello World"
tell application "ClipBoard"
  open dirname
  save
end tell
</pre>
<p>
A couple of caveats - This is not the interface I hope to use.  Adding simple Appllescript to application is very painful so I had to hack in some code from a sample and was stuck with the UI.  Someday I will do a good job.
<p>
The other problem is that CLipBoard in its publish process cannot seem to let go of the CPU ever so nothing else runs.  Believe me, I tried to let go of the CPU, but most of the work is deep in QuickTime calls which I could not make multithreaded.
<li>
Auto-Document-Grab - When enabled, this will cause the "Grab" button to be pushed after 30 seconds if the user has not pressed the grab button.  It is a feature to play with.  The UI could be improved a bit so you could turn it on and off during lecture record, rather than only once.
</ul>
