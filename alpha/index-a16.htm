There were two A16's  10:16AM and 10:19PM 
<p>
10:19PM Version
<ul>
<li>
Lots more testing/coding - I spent hours testing every combination of
frame capture technique, driver, screen size, and algorithm.  I finally 
found a hacked up combination that will support two video sources (reasonably)
well - You can use an IREZ CapSure and and IREZ Kritter/USB together.  
I used the Dazzle and it craps out in all cases when paired with another 
camera.
<li>
Unfortunately, I have not found a solution will provides two "video-in"
digitizers so you could use it in a classroom with two cameras.
<li>
Also, unfortunately because the IREZ Kritter/USB seems to make bad .mov files,
the only real configuration which I have not yet seen a problem is to use the
CapSure (or Irez KritterPCMCIA) as the "instructor-cam" and the Kritter/USB
as the "document-cam".  Ah well.  That is enough for one day.
</ul>
10:16AM Version
<ul>
<li>
Changed the JPEG quality from good to high during make lecture
<li>
Spent HOURS working on making the dual-camera stuff work.  Learned a lot
but am stil missing something.  I made things a little cleaner.
</ul>
Using two cameras is VERY problematic.  Different drivers behave differently
in different combination.  Even screen size seems to make a difference.
Audio-only with a document camera uses Quicktime provided high-level routines
to do the heavy lifting so it works swell.  Because those routines (SG*) don't 
like two sequence grabbers going and can't handle two video sources in one 
grabber, to support two video sources, I must work at a lower level creating 
hundreds of lines of code where there formerly was 10 or so.
<p>
I stil believe that it can be made to work - I just have not found the 
magic bullet.
