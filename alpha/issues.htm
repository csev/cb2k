<h2>Issues in ClipBoard-2000</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Once the recording has started you cannot drag the window - The QT code to 
do this while recording seems to blow up on me.  Drag the window before you
start recording.
<li>
I have not tested with extremely long lectures - 
it might blow up - I don't know.  Look for hitting ther 2GB limit 
on uncompressed lectures.
<li>
If you change the name or select the wrong directory on the 
recompression dialog box, Merge Media will not find it.  The problem is that 
I cannot figure out how to get the settings dialog up without allowing the
user to change the filename.
<li>
Office-98 on the MAC seems to ignore my requests to set the image size 
during the Save As HTML Wizard - Solution - Do it on a PC and FTP the files :(
<ul>
