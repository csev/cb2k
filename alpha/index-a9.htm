<h1>Alpha Version 8</h1>

<p>
Alpha 9 is the merge of the source trees for the PC and Mac versions of
the code plus all the improvements of 
<a href=index-a8.htm>Alpha 8</a>.
<ul>
<li>I did make the ability to start on a blank screen work in this release. (1/9/2000)
<li>Also this version includes a feature I added during the PC port - 
that is automatic switching between scribble and text mode.
</ul>
Still to do: 
<pre>
Exit capture gracefully -  All errors non fatal
Allow resizing during publishing
</pre>
TTFN
