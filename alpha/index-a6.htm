Well, it is Halloween and I have just finished handing out candy 
to the kiddies so it is time to upload alpha 6.
<p>
Alpha 5 was created just before the trip to Educause in Long Beach.  After 
the Educause demo, Kurt Ackman of Apple said that 
he was about to tell a bunch of folks about CB2K so I 
figured that I should fix a few nagging bugs.  I also want to start using 
it to do a few longer talks myself that I plan to keep.  Here is some
of the bugs fixed:
<ul>
<li>Fixed the slow loss of synchronization - turns out I was using ticks
rather than microseconds.  Ticks are not "real-time" only microseconds.
This still is a little problem
in long lectures with lots of drawing - but I think that is rounding.
<li>Fixed a problem of drawing where the pen seemed to stay down at the 
wrong time (only in the quicktime lecture).  
<li>
Increased the table sizes for the draw,pointer, and text and images. 
Added some error checking on the image table size during recording and 
some sanity checks during the reaload of the infor from the .txt files.
Fixed a crash during the lecture generation that turned out to be a negative
duration.
<li>Fixed a problem where the end of the lecture got messed up and 
the last thing the user saw was a blank screen.
</ul>
TTFN
