<h1>Hardware Requirements for ClipBoard-2000</h1>
<p>
ClipBoard-2000 requires a PowerPC Macintosh.  The exact performance will
depend on how much video compression you are trying to do 
"live".   For example 8 frames per second photoJPEG takes far less CPU than
30 frames per second Sorensen.  Also, USB takes more processor than a 
PCMCIA solution.
<p>
So in lieu of a precise hardware requirements spec, instead, I will
tell you what I develop with.   Things will work on that system and
work on many others.
<pre>
PowerBook G3 333Mhz (modern version with USB)
128MB Ram (upgraded from 64MB)
</pre>
I would appreciate it if folks could tell me what slower computers they have
used successfully and I will add to the following list:
<ul>
<li>
Mac 7100/80 - used successfully to do an audio-only presentation - Thanks to Terry
</ul>
<p>
Cameras:
<p>
I really like the cameras from www.irez.com, orderable from 
www.macconnection.com (and many other places).  These are the cameras that 
I have tested:
<PRE>
KritterCam (PCMCIA) - Currently out of production awaiting the Kritter SV
Kritter CapSure (PCMCIA)
KritterCam USB (although I am not wild about the quality)
</PRE>
I have tried the Dazzle Digital Photo Maker and it seemed to work, but like most USB solutions, it bummed me out.
<p>
In general because I use the QuickTime libraries, most any capture solution will work.
Unfortunately the ideal solution for portables is not available any more 
(Kritter PCMCIA).  SO until the Kriter/SV comes out we will have to tolerate
the USB solutions :(
