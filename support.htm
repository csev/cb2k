<h2>Technical Support as of
Thu Feb 24 12:57:37 EST 2000
</h2>
With free software which is worked on part-time, there is not a lot of
technical support.  However because I believe firmly in this type of media,
I try to do as much as I can to support early adopters.  If you have a question
or a problem, make sure to join the ClipBoard-2000 mailing list.  I read the
list several times daily and usually respond quickly - unless I am travelling
or in a 48-hour coding marathon holed up in a basement.
<h2>Hardware to Buy</h2>
Take a look at the <a href=hardware.htm>hardware</a> specs.
<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<b>Document Camera Support</b> - 
Dual Camera document camera support has finally vielded a little bit in 
Alpha 17 and later.  The best combination is the IREZ/CapSure for the document
camera at 640x480 image size and the Dazzle DM-5000 as the instructor-cam.
The combination needs some testing before it is declared truly reliable.
I am looking for experience with other combinations of capture 
hardware/software.
<p>
Using only one video
source, the document camera is very reliable.  This is because when there
is only one camera, it uses the straightforward/reliable technique for the 
video capture.  
Another solution if you have tape is to run the process twice
or even use two computers.  First record the lecturer 
using the document camera and audio, taping everything.  Then redigitize the
media using something like VidCap or HackTV - then replace the rawmedia.mov 
file - and viola! you have a good quality document camera and good quality 
audio/video - and no bugs.
There is a feature called "Sync-Only" which tries to make this easier.
<p>
<b>VST FireWire Drives</b> it has been reported that there are problems 
when your lecture directory is on a VST Firewire drive.  Symptoms include
bad captures, bad recompression steps, and bad "make lectures".  So far, I am
suspecting the fact that it is formatted as a PC disk and not a Mac disk.  
But this needs more testing.  Perhaps Zips formatted as PC would exhibit the
same behaviour.
<p>
<b>IREZ USB Camera</b> - This camera seems to have problems with 
general capture to disk using the Quicktime Sequence Grabber.  
The symptom is that at the end of the lecture I get an error code indicating
"bad duration" and the resulting rawmedia.mov file is large but worthless.
Smart people have told me not to waste time trying to recover the data.
Interestingly, it is the same code which works with at least 7-8 other 
capture hardware setups.  This leads me to believe that it is the Kritter's
problem.  Also the Apple sample application HackTV fails in the same way.
</ul>
<h2>Other Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Once the recording has started you cannot drag the window - The QT code to 
do this while recording seems to blow up on me.  Drag the window before you
start recording.
<li>
I have not tested with extremely long lectures - 
it might blow up - I don't know.  Look for hitting ther 2GB limit 
on uncompressed lectures.
<li>
If you change the name or select the wrong directory on the 
recompression dialog box, Merge Media will not find it.  The problem is that 
I cannot figure out how to get the settings dialog up without allowing the
user to change the filename.
<li>
Office-98 on the MAC seems to ignore my requests to set the image size 
during the Save As HTML Wizard - Solution - Do it on a PC and FTP the files :(
<ul>
